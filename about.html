          interesting AI projects; game development tools;</b
        >whether you know how to use ChatGPT or other gpt tools? Have you ever
        developed a personal website (if so, please attach a link), feel free to
        share the skills you have mastered or learned.

      <p>Talking about a specific project I am proud of.</p>

      <h3>
